## Dataset Overview

Acquired stock api from alphavantage and created a view for 1mo-3mo-6mo of data for any stock. Unfortunately free api doesn't allow more data to be pulled hence the short range. 

## Project Highlights:

Data Cleaning: The dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process to ensure accuracy and reliability in subsequent analyses.

Visualization with Power BI: Microsoft Power BI was employed to create insightful visualizations that offer a clear understanding of the stock data

Sentiment Analysis: filtered news by bullish/bearish sentiments

Upcoming Ipo and earnings date: has a page to showcase IPO and earnings.
